Still using this? Congrats you know how to update stuff. 
Otherwise this code will serve no use for people who are looking for a free bot that they can host instantly.
This is one `discord.js v11` and hopefully you know that's a good year+ outdated.

## For yall self-hostess out there
The code here is **strictly** an example (Currently, it is the messed-up code). Running this code on your own is **NOT** supported;
I will **NOT** be providing the **resources** necessary to self-host.
Please do **NOT** try to tape this code back together!
